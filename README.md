**Introduction**

Welcome to our guide on crafting dynamic, user-friendly, and captivating visualizations using Tableau for data analysis. In this project, we embark on a journey of gathering, assessing, exploring, and manipulating data using the versatile pandas library in Python, culminating in the creation of an engaging dashboard in Tableau.

**Data**

Our dataset of choice is the London bike sharing dataset sourced from Kaggle. Featuring 10 insightful columns, including timestamp, number of bike rides, real temperature, perceived temperature, humidity percentage, wind speed, weather code, holiday, weekend, and season code, it provides a rich foundation for our analysis.

**Code**

Our Python-based approach leverages essential libraries such as pandas, zipfile, and kaggle. With the Kaggle API, we programmatically fetch the dataset, initiating a journey of exploration, assessment, and manipulation. Through meticulous customization of column names, conversion of humidity values to percentages, and mapping of integers to descriptive values for season and weather columns, we ensure clarity and precision in our analysis.

**Visualizations**

Five captivating visualizations grace our Tableau dashboard:

1. **Moving Average Chart**: At the forefront, this dynamic chart offers a compelling narrative of trends and patterns.

2. **Total Bike Rides Chart**: Provides insights into the overall usage trends.

3. **Temperature vs. Wind Speed Heat Map**: Visualizes the relationship between temperature and wind speed, aiding in weather analysis.

4. **Additional Visuals in Tooltip**: Enhances interactivity by embedding two visuals within the tooltip.

By harnessing user-defined dynamic parameters and calculated fields, we empower users to interactively navigate the dashboard. Furthermore, set actions enable seamless control of the moving average chart.
